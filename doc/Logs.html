<B>LOGS</B>
<BR>&nbsp;
<UL>6/8/98&nbsp;&nbsp; - First inklings of the pl2sd and sd2pl routines
to test the VM. I made sure the CRC routines worked and worked
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
out the module format.
<BR>6/9/98&nbsp;&nbsp; - Understood that the SD, then VM and then ASM/Lang/GC
environ is a long path
<BR>6/11/98 - Got my Objective-C libraries to generate SimpleData (SD)
dumps of objective-C object trees.
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
I built an app to run the VM and debugged it.
<BR>6/12/98 - Actually finished that stuff and had a reader of the SD format
working.
<BR>6/15/98 - Had the linker portion running. (morning)
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P><B>Goals</B>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 6/24/98 - Get a C based SD to Bubl objects routine
working, get a C based Linker (build a malloc and collector, routines that
will take SD and build a Bubl Objects- runtime), runtime to manipulate
the objects via C, Linker...

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Get malloc working.
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; Get symbol table hash working
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; Get sd2bubl routine working in C
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; Get GC working
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; Get runtime working
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; Get VM working
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; Get VM&nbsp;kicking a little more
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; RUN

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; For a full compiler:

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Get an assembler working, then get a compiler working.
The assembler should be able to describe a Bubl module.
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the assembler, there will be the Compiler.
<BR>&nbsp;

<P><B>Milestone 1: The bare minimum</B>
<BR><B>Milestone 2: Put the OS to work</B>
