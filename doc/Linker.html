<b>Linker/Debugger Info</b>
<br>&nbsp;
<p>This section will describe how the linking occurs from a persistent
stored representation of an Aqua module.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<ul>In general, the module has to have linker information. This information,
since it is already in SD form,&nbsp; will basically be in a form that
most other linkers would eventually have to build.
<p>The linker will have three sections. Labels, Unresolved, and Debugger
info.
<p>The labels will mention
<br>&nbsp;
<p>The debugger info is special. When a program is linked at run time,
the linker will place all debugger sections in a global pool. This is so
the VM can find the debugger info when an exception occurs. It will need
to be able to identify a source module, a line #, and an address. Since
the access path for this information that will be needed is via address,
it will be sorted in address order. Also, since this could be a lot of
information it will rely on the SD format's ability to point to unique
strings.
<br>&nbsp;</ul>
<b>Goals</b>
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>7/8/98 - First creation based on info from 6/7/98
