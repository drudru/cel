<B>SimpleDataFormat</B>
<BR>&nbsp;
<P>This is a binary stream format that can be used to store a datastructure
orgranized as a smalltalk-like dictionary. This dictionary can contain
dictionaries, arrays, 7-bit ASCII strings, integers (1,2,4,8 byte), floats
(ascii or in IEEE) date-time, blobs (binary data), comments??,or another
SimpleDataStructure. This format will be self describing, given the knowledge
of just these types. It should also be powerful enough to describe most
of the structures needed by the operating system. The goal is to have a
powerfull language that can just read in this tree with just one command
and begin to access it. It will also allow the language to serialize this
structure in one command as well.
<P>8/17/98 - More has been fleshed out about this format. I originally
implemented a format like this in my early tests. However, I quickly learned
I would need to refer to objects previously defined or undefined for the
real linker. This caused me to change my mind on the format. The format
will now treat all of the items as objects. When a slot in a dictionary
refers to its data, it will actually be refering to a file-object-id. This
refers to a record previously or not previously defined. In fact, the object
format will look very much like the format in memory now as well and the
slots will have type indicators (GET, SET, GETSTACK, etc....). All of these
types will be considered to be individual object records.
<P>So, the first proto that gets written out will state that a proto is
getting written.....(CONTINUE HERE)
<P>12/27/99 - I think the above date is wrong. At any rate, only reference
id's to previous objects were added. We will now go all the way and really
mimic the dictiionary format that is present in the system. That means
that there will be references to the data slots by the keys and those data
slots will have action types (GET, SET, GETSTACK, etc.).
<P>(the comment field and embedded SimpleDataFormat stream are in question)
<P>The format will be in binary and it will be well defined. The reason
it will be in binary rather than ascii isn't for space reasons, it is more
for reasons of integrity.&nbsp; If the format was ascii, anybody with and
editor could place data in the file. This makes checking it more difficult
and slow. There will be utilities and editors to edit these files and insure
that their simple format is intact. Then higher level programs can verify
that the representation of the data is valid (i.e it is a valid code module,
etc.)
<P>Most of the files used by the system will be in this format. For example,
the programs, libraries, etc. will all be in this format. That way, any
program should have the ability to modify these files easily.
<P>CRC's are still in question, as well as MD5, etc. These routines will
have to skip an element/block of bytes&nbsp; in order to work. This is
not the most optimum&nbsp; of solutions. This will mean that there will
be an extra compare when moving the pointer. So, when scanning the data,
the routine will need, the start of the data, the pointer to the area to
skip, and the length (including that area). For the CRC, this bill be a
4-byte area, for the MD5, this will be a 16 byte area. On second thought,
this doesn't sound to bad and it gives the implementer flexibility when
building the CRC/MD5. Now, since there will be multiple checksums, there
will need to be a convention on which one gets the priority when doing
reads or writes.
<P>6/7/98 - I'll just tag them on the end. They are optional and a CRC
is done first, if there is one.
<BR>Also, do I need to
<BR>&nbsp;
<P>The types stored
<BR>--------------
<P>Dictionaries - (key,values)
<BR>Arrays
<BR>ASCII - (7 bit only)
<BR>Integers - (1,2,4,8 byte)
<BR>Floats - (IEEE standard and ASCII)
<BR>Date-Time
<BR>Blobs
<P>(Also, there will be a simple token for each type, followed by an optional
param or count (arrays/dictionaries),
<BR>&nbsp;and then there will be a double check by having an end token
for things with counts)
<P>The format
<BR>----------
<P>All Data is in network byte order.
<P>SimpleDataFormat &lt;- &lt;Header> &lt;Dictionary> [CRC] [MD5]
<P>Header:
<BR><B>"AqUa SimpleDaTa\nddd\n???\n"</B>
<BR>&lt;4 byte length>
<BR>This is a 20 byte header. The ddd represents a version without the
decimal in ascii '103' represents 1.03
<BR>The ??? is an options indicator in ASCII. Only the first ? is defined
as a 'c'. This indicates a CRC follows the
<BR>block.
<P>The next item should be a dictionary

<P>5/16/98 - First creation
<BR>5/17/98 - 5/18/98 - Continued
<BR>6/5/98 -&nbsp; Continued with more info (types/stored) and format
<BR>6/6/98 - More work and info transfered from paper. Figured out the
details on CRC and wheter to support multi byte intsc
<BR>6/7/98 - The basic Idea is down. Need to just work out the module format.
<BR>6/15/98 - Made a few changes to what characters were used as delimiters
a while ago. Now I'm changing the Array delimiters, I'm also making sure
things are correct
<BR>7/8/98 - Added the change for the Todo
<BR>8/17/98 - Decided to change the format to handle the "mulitple links
to the same object" requirement&nbsp; (cycles in the graph) This removes
the todo of wanting unique strings since that is done as a side effect.
<BR>3/29/99 - Added, the nil object, this is just as important.
<BR>9/25/99 - Added the 'reference' object so that this indicates it refers
to an object identified as an integer'
<BR>9/26/99 - Changed the format so that there are two references. Also,
I added the reference object to the string and to the dictionary as part
of the definition (instead of using 'R'. It was ambiguous.)
