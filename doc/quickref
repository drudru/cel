Ok - I always keep forgetting *BAD SIGN*

What are the parent-local and the code-proto 
places for on the stack.

The parent local is the stack mapped parent for an activation.
It gets used rather than the below mentioned code-proto reference
when a new activation is started. It is the
true instance being worked on. 

the code proto is for the pushSelf operation. Throughout the
code timeline, self is required. Therefore, we store this
in the frame so we can get it when we need it.
