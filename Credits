Credits for other people and things I've used
----------------------------------------------------

The hash routines used are by  Bob Jenkins:
---------
lookupa.c, by Bob Jenkins, December 1996.  Same as lookup2.c
You may use this code in any way you wish.  It has no warranty.

The malloc I used was originally the Doug Lea malloc. I had to drop it,
though, since it wasn't flexible about it's internal strucures.
Still, I mention it because it is a decent, but fairly static malloc and
I think I did use some of the C macros from it.


Berkeley/Freebsd - CSRG - I used some of their high quality code


The ideas and structures are HEAVILY borrowed from the papers/books
on:
Self (which was influenced by Smalltalk-80, which was influenced by Lisp),
Objective-C (which was influenced by Smalltalk, C,),
Forth (the inner workings specifically)
Newtonscript 



OS's Used
-----
I originally began development of this OS on a Nextstep 3.2 Intel system.
It then moved to a FreeBSD 2.2 system.
Later on, I moved to Linux 2.0.36 for no particular reason and then to Linux 2.2.x
I continue to use both Linux and FreeBSD.


People
----------

Prototype based languages were pushed by Steve Dekorte, without which,
I probably wouldn't have gone this way, this soon.

The main people behind Self (whose shoulders I stood on) were:
David Ungar, Randall Smith - and the whole Self team.

Jecel Assumpcao Jr - he is probably 'the' driving force for prototypes and
Self technologies. Hi also runs the Self Interest mailing list moderator, and is
great help to many.

Brian Swetland - great guy and fun to work with. He was the first to download
Cel and play with it.

Squeak - I used Squeak in 1998?. It was an inspiration.

.. which leads to Smalltalk. THANKS to all the people who created and supported
that project. (I did use Digitalk Smalltalk in 1990? on an educational discount)

I was first introduced to Smalltalk by a Byte magazine issue with a big balloon 
on it.

Levine - Lex/Yacc O'Reilly Book and the compilers newsgroup was helpful, but
I didn't use Lex or Yacc :-).


Unix - thanks to all who have made Unix throughout the years.

------------

Libraries

I use SleepyCat as a database library. It is the cleanest one I've
used so far.

I use glibc, it just happens to be on every box that I use.

Boutell - You can link to his GD kit, I don't distribute it with the code, but
it is an easy, simple package (ie. it's not GL).
