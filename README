Hello!

This is the 'Cel' language distribution.
The best place to learn more is at the web site.

BE sure to check out the Release Notes.

*License*
This entire package is covered by the license in
the file 'License'.

*Brief Intro*
'Cel' is a fine example of a Prototype based, pure
Object Oriented language.
It is interpreted by a simple virtual machine and it
has a syntax similar to the languages Self or Smalltalk.
(NOTE, the syntax is on the horizon to change)
At this point in time, it is more of an example, than
a production environment (it lacks documentation, etc).
However, I do use it for various tasks on my systems.
The goal is to provide a good system to explore the
prototype based programming model.


*Platform Issues*
This has been tested on Linux, Win32, and Mac OS X.

WIN32
Windows requires an environment in order to build.
The environment is the Mingw/Msys environment.
This is *extremely* easy to install and run, just
download the tarballs and setup one PATH environment
variable and you are good to go.


*How To Build*
The build is kind of archaic. (Old School) 

UNIX/LINUX/MAC OS X

0.  cd to the 'cel' directory
1.  type '/bin/sh config.unix'
2.  type './build.sh'


WINDOWS 

0.  cd to the 'cel' directory
1.  type '/bin/sh config.win32'
2.  type './build.sh'

This should make all the files in all of the other directories.
It builds in 2 phases. If all goes well, it will indicate that
the Phase 2 build was good.

You are done. There should be a file in the
vm directory called 'cel'.

You should then be able to run most of the samples.

KIT BUILDING
Unfortunately, the language doesn't build the kits on 
the fly. (This will be fixed). You need to manually 
build them with a script before use.
This is simple, go into the kits directory and type './builder'.
It just wraps the manual task
of, for example, doing '../vm/cel Socket'. That
will make the Socket.cel kit. Do that for each '*.cel' file. 

Now if you go into the samples directory, there
are some sample files. You can execute
them by going '../vm/cel test8'. 



*How To Contribute/Give Feedback*
