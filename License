Brief Intro on the License

All of the code in this distribution is covered by this license.
Cel is free software: it can be used for both academic and
commercial purposes at absolutely no cost.
There are no royalties or GNU-like "copyleft" restrictions.
Cel qualifies as Open Source software since it uses the
Apache/(BSD like) License (every other license was long and
full of legalese). Nevertheless, Cel is not in the public domain
and Dru keeps its copyright (until I can form some sort of Foundation,
if this goes that far :-). The main reason I state 'Foundation' is that
I don't want to own contributions, I want them to be owned by the project. 
The real legal details are below. 

Again, does any of this look familiar?  It should, this is a
modified Apache (BSD) License.
I like their License, I like their web server, and I like their group.
